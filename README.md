This project is an advanced C++ command-line application for solving complex problems in Mathematical Optimization, particularly focusing on Linear Programming (LP) and Nonlinear Optimization algorithms. A key feature is the use of fractional arithmetic (type frac, defined and implemented in the code) to ensure absolute precision in all calculations, avoiding the floating-point errors common in standard solvers. A vector and matrix type were also implemented.

This project is meant to be compiled and executed on Windows.
